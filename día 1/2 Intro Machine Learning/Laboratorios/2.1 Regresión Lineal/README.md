## Module 6: Introduction to Machine Learning

This folder contains introductory video lectures to familiarize students with the principles of machine learning 

## Slides  

**Introduction to Machine Learning** introduces the concept and theory behind of machine learning

## Labs

**Lab 6 - Introduction to Machine Learning** 

In this lab, you will use Azure Machine Learning to train, evaluate, and publish a classification model, a
regression model, and a clustering model.

## Data

This lab uses two data sets:

Automobile make and model data is in *makes.csv* and *autos.csv*


## Code

The code for Lab 6 are in the following files:

- PrepAutos.R
- PrepAutos.py

## Gallery

**Lab 6** full solution can be found in the Azure ML Gallery:
